These notebooks are saved with unevaluated output.

They are guranteered to work only on ipython>=0.13 and only if the notebook was
ran with the profile supplied in this folder.
# TODO merge this profile and the sympy profile.

The testrunner evaluates each notebook checking for exceptions. In order for
the testrunner to run correctly you need to have installed the supplied profile
under the name profile_nbserver_sympytest.


The documentation makefile evaluates each notebook and creates a page in the
documentation for each of them. You need to install the supplied profile as
for the test runner. You also need to have nbconvert installed.
